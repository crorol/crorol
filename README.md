Hello, I'm a student currently studying computer science with a focus on programming and cybersecurity. I'm learning Python, C, and Web Hacking, and I'm passionate about growing my skills as a tech professional. While cybersecurity interests me the most right now, I'm also exploring other fields like software development and system engineering to see what fits me best. 

I'm based in ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· South Korea and hope to study and work in ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ Canada in the future.
